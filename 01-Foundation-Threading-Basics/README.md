# Phase 1: Foundation - Threading Basics 🏗️

Welcome mawa! Ee phase lo, manam Java Multithreading ki foundation vesthunam. Ekkada unna concepts chala strong ga nerchukunte, future lo advanced topics easy ga ardam avtayi.

## 📚 Learning Path

Ee phase lo manam ee topics cover chestam:

1.  **[1.1: Core Concepts & Theory](./01-Core-Concepts-and-Theory.md)**
    - **What you'll learn:** Process vs Thread, Concurrency vs Parallelism, JVM Memory Model, and Thread Lifecycle.
    - **Difficulty:** 🟢 Beginner
    - **Time:** 1.5 hours

2.  **[1.2: Creating & Managing Threads](./02-Creating-and-Managing-Threads.md)**
    - **What you'll learn:** `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface use chesi threads create cheyadam, `start()`, `run()`, `join()`, `interrupt()`, and daemon threads gurinchi.
    - **Difficulty:** 🟢 Beginner
    - **Time:** 2.5 hours

3.  **[1.3: Java Memory Model (JMM)](./03-Java-Memory-Model.md)**
    - **What you'll learn:** Visibility problems, instruction reordering, and the `happens-before` relationship. Idi konchem tricky topic, but chala important.
    - **Difficulty:** 🟡 Intermediate
    - **Time:** 2 hours

## 🎯 Goal for this Phase

Ee phase complete ayye sariki, neeku ee questions ki clear ga answers teliyali:
- Java lo threads ante enti and avi enduku use chestaru?
- Threads ni ela create cheyali and valla lifecycle ni ela manage cheyali?
- Multiple threads use chesinappudu memory lo em problems vastayi?

Ready aa? Let's start with the first topic! 🚀
